For this portfolio project the goal was to create a ruby gem and scrape a site for its data. One example given was a Daily Deals CLI, that when prompted would scrape two sites that advertised their top deals of the day and return the two deals to the user. From there, the user could see more information about each deal if they were interested. 

[The example project can be found here](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/daily_deal)


When trying to think about what I would want to create, I was hesitant to accidentally use what others had created un the past, ie Kickstarter, Top Restaurants, etc. Something I thought would be a bit timely would be to create a CLI that would return the latest statistics on the coronavirus pandemic.
