Git is a necessary tool for coworking and collaborating as a developer. There are a few commands that will be essential in the beginning: 

* Initialize a Git repository with `git init`
* Check the status of a repository with`git status`
* Keep track of file changes with `git add`
* Create a commit and apply a commit message with `git commit -m "message"`
* To commit any files added with git add and any updated files along with it usegit `commit -a`
* `ls` which gives a list of all the files in the directory
* `git touch` will create a new, blank file
* `mkdir` will create a new folder
